# FiverrResearch
The goal of this project is to conduct market research on the Fiverr marketplace. The goal is to scrape and clean data from Google Play Store and the Apple Store regarding the Fiverr app to understand how users feel about the marketplace.
I hope to build a wordcloud to see the most commonly used terms used to describe the app.
